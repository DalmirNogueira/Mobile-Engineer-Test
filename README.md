# Mobile-Engineer-Test

- Visually it works (aka compiles without bugs) but not according to requirements
- Tried to use Retrofit but ended up using Volley (I beleive I can't request "avatar_url" due to the underscore)

# ToDo

- Add TextViews for the quantity of repos (static 5 at the moment)
- Get language of each repository (still don't know how)
- Something is still wrong on request
